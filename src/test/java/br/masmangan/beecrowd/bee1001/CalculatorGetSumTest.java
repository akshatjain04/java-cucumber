ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSum_d38a33793d

Scenario 1: Validate getSum with positive numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are positive. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to positive numbers using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum against the expected sum.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds two positive numbers. The expected result is the sum of a and b. This test is significant as it verifies the primary functionality of the getSum method.

Scenario 2: Validate getSum with negative numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are negative. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to negative numbers using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum against the expected sum.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds two negative numbers. The expected result is the sum of a and b. This test is important as it checks the method's ability to handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Validate getSum with zero
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when one of the input number is zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a to any number and b to zero using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum against the expected sum.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds a number and zero. The expected result is the number itself. This test is significant as it tests the method's behavior with zero.

Scenario 4: Validate getSum with maximum integer values
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithMaxIntValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when the input numbers are maximum integer values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to maximum integer values using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum against the expected sum.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly handles maximum integer values. The expected result is twice the maximum integer value. This test is important as it checks the method's ability to handle large numbers.
