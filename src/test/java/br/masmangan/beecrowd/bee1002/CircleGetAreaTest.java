"""
Scenario 1: Test for Zero Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithZeroRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns 0 when the radius is set to 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius of the Circle object to 0 using the setRadius method.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with zero radius is indeed 0. This is important to ensure the getArea method correctly calculates the area in edge cases.

Scenario 2: Test for Positive Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithPositiveRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns the correct area when the radius is a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius of the Circle object to a known positive number using the setRadius method.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area matches the expected value calculated manually.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a positive radius is correctly calculated. This is the standard use case for the getArea method.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithNegativeRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method handles the scenario where the radius is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius of the Circle object to a negative number using the setRadius method.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is NaN (Not a Number) or throws an appropriate exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getArea method correctly handles invalid input (negative radius). This is important for ensuring the robustness of the method.

/*
The test failure is due to the assertion in the test method `testAreaWithNegativeRadius()`. The test is expecting the area of the circle to be NaN (Not a Number) when the radius of the circle is negative. However, the method `getArea()` in the business logic does not handle this case and it simply returns the calculated area even when the radius is negative.

In the formula for the area of a circle, the radius is squared (multiplied by itself). Squaring a negative number results in a positive number. So, if the radius is negative, the method `getArea()` will still return a positive number, because the square of a negative number is a positive number. This is why the actual result is not NaN, causing the assertion to fail.

To fix this issue, the `getArea()` method should be updated to check if the radius is negative, and in that case, it should return NaN or throw an exception. This would make the method align with the expectation of the test, that the area of a circle with a negative radius is not a valid concept.

    circle.setRadius(-5.0);
    double actualArea = circle.getArea();
    assertTrue(Double.isNaN(actualArea), "Area of circle with negative radius should be NaN");
