"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are positive. This is a basic functionality check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 2: Case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllZeroGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are zero. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 3: Case where all grades are negative

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are negative. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 4: Case where grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithMixedGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when grades a, b, c are a mix of positive and negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with a mix of positive and negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers. This is another functionality check for the getAverage() method.

/*
The test `testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades` is failing due to an assertion error. The test expected the average to be 3.7, but the actual value was 3.8. 

This discrepancy arises from the computation in the `getAverage` method in the `StudentGrade` class. The average is calculated as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`, where a, b, and c are set to 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 respectively. 

The correct calculation should be `(2.0 * 2.0 + 3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0` which equals 3.8. 

The test case `testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades` is incorrect because it expects the result to be 3.7 when it should expect 3.8 according to the business logic in `getAverage` method. 

Therefore, the failure is not a result of a compilation error, an unhandled scenario in the business logic, or an issue with external dependencies. It is due to an incorrect expected value in the test case itself.

    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(3.7, result, 0.001);

/*
The test `testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades` is failing because the expected value in the `assertEquals` function is incorrect. 

The test is trying to assert that the average of the weights (-2.0, -3.0, -5.0) is -3.7. But the average is calculated in the `getAverage` method as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. So the average of the given weights should be `((-2.0 * 2.0) + (-3.0 * 3.0) + (-5.0 * 5.0)) / 10.0` which equals -3.8, not -3.7. 

This can be seen in the error log: `org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <-3.7> but was: <-3.8>`. The test is expecting -3.7 but the actual result returned by `getAverage` method is -3.8. Therefore, the assertion fails and the test does not pass. 

The test should be corrected by changing the expected value in the `assertEquals` function to -3.8.
@Test

    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();
    studentGrade.setA(-2.0);
    studentGrade.setB(-3.0);
    studentGrade.setC(-5.0);
    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(-3.7, result, 0.001);
}

/*
The error log indicates that the test `testAverageWithMixedGrades` is failing due to an assertion failure. The test expected the result of the method `getAverage` to be 2.3, but it was 2.0. 

The `getAverage` method calculates the average as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. In the test `testAverageWithMixedGrades`, `a` is set to 2.0, `b` to -3.0, and `c` to 5.0. If you calculate the average using these values, you get `(2.0 * 2.0 + -3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = 2.0` and not 2.3.

Therefore, the test is failing because the expected value specified in the test does not match the actual result of the method under test. The test assertion is incorrect.
