"""
Scenario 1: Test for Zero Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithZeroRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns 0 when the radius is set to 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius of the Circle object to 0 using the setRadius method.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with zero radius is indeed zero. This test is important to ensure the getArea method handles the edge case of zero radius correctly.

Scenario 2: Test for Positive Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithPositiveRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns the correct value when the radius is a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius of the Circle object to a positive number (say, 1) using the setRadius method.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is PI.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with radius 1 is PI. This test is crucial to ensure the getArea method calculates area correctly for positive radius values.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithNegativeRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns the correct value when the radius is a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius of the Circle object to a negative number (say, -1) using the setRadius method.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is positive (since the square of a negative number is positive).
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with negative radius is positive. This test is important to ensure the getArea method handles negative radius values correctly.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithLargeRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method can handle large radius values without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius of the Circle object to a large number (say, 1E308) using the setRadius method.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is not Infinity (indicating overflow).
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getArea method can handle large radius values without overflow. This test is crucial to ensure the method works correctly under extreme conditions.
