"""
Scenario 1: Validate setA method with positive integer
Details:
  TestName: validateSetWithPositiveInteger
  Description: This test is meant to check the setA method when a positive integer is provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator instance and a positive integer.
  Act: Invoke the setA method with the positive integer.
  Assert: Use the getSum or getProduct methods to verify the input was correctly set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly sets the value of 'a' when a positive integer is provided. This is significant as it confirms the basic functionality of the setA method.

Scenario 2: Validate setA method with negative integer
Details:
  TestName: validateSetWithNegativeInteger
  Description: This test is meant to check the setA method when a negative integer is provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator instance and a negative integer.
  Act: Invoke the setA method with the negative integer.
  Assert: Use the getSum or getProduct methods to verify the input was correctly set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly sets the value of 'a' when a negative integer is provided. This is significant as it confirms the setA method can handle negative integers.

Scenario 3: Validate setA method with zero
Details:
  TestName: validateSetWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the setA method when zero is provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator instance and zero.
  Act: Invoke the setA method with zero.
  Assert: Use the getSum or getProduct methods to verify the input was correctly set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly sets the value of 'a' when zero is provided. This is significant as it confirms the setA method can handle zero as an input.

Scenario 4: Validate setA method with maximum integer
Details:
  TestName: validateSetWithMaxInteger
  Description: This test is meant to check the setA method when the maximum integer value is provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator instance and the maximum integer value.
  Act: Invoke the setA method with the maximum integer.
  Assert: Use the getSum or getProduct methods to verify the input was correctly set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly sets the value of 'a' when the maximum integer is provided. This is significant as it confirms the setA method can handle the maximum integer value.

Scenario 5: Validate setA method with minimum integer
Details:
  TestName: validateSetWithMinInteger
  Description: This test is meant to check the setA method when the minimum integer value is provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator instance and the minimum integer value.
  Act: Invoke the setA method with the minimum integer.
  Assert: Use the getSum or getProduct methods to verify the input was correctly set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly sets the value of 'a' when the minimum integer is provided. This is significant as it confirms the setA method can handle the minimum integer value.
