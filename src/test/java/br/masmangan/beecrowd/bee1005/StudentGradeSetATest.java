Scenario 1: Validate Correct Assignment of 'a' Grade

Details:
  TestName: testCorrectAssignmentOfAGrade
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setA correctly assigns the provided grade to the student's 'a' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Define a double value to represent the 'a' grade.
  Act: Invoke the setA method on the instance of StudentGrade, passing the defined 'a' grade.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the average grade calculated by getAverage method against the expected average.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'a' grade has been correctly assigned. The expected result is based on the calculation (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is significant as it ensures the integrity of the student's 'a' grade.

Scenario 2: Validate Negative Value Assignment to 'a' Grade

Details:
  TestName: testNegativeValueAssignmentToAGrade
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setA correctly handles the scenario when a negative value is provided as 'a' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Define a negative double value to represent the 'a' grade.
  Act: Invoke the setA method on the instance of StudentGrade, passing the defined 'a' grade.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the average grade calculated by getAverage method against the expected average.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'a' grade does not accept negative values. The expected result is based on the calculation (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0, considering 'a' as zero if a negative value is provided. This test is significant as it ensures the integrity of the student's 'a' grade in a scenario of invalid input.

Scenario 3: Validate Large Value Assignment to 'a' Grade

Details:
  TestName: testLargeValueAssignmentToAGrade
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setA correctly handles the scenario when a large value is provided as 'a' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Define a large double value to represent the 'a' grade.
  Act: Invoke the setA method on the instance of StudentGrade, passing the defined 'a' grade.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the average grade calculated by getAverage method against the expected average.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'a' grade can handle large values. The expected result is based on the calculation (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is significant as it verifies the method's ability to handle a wide range of input values.
