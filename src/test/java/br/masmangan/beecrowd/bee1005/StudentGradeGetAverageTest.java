"""
Scenario 1: Test for Normal Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithNormalValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when normal values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set normal values (for example, a=2.0 and b=3.0).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with normal values. The expected result is 3.1363636363636362. This test is significant as it tests the basic functionality of the getAverage method.

Scenario 2: Test for Zero Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithZeroValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when zero values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set zero values (for example, a=0.0 and b=0.0).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with zero values. The expected result is 0.0. This test is significant as it tests the scenario where the student has scored zero in both the subjects.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithNegativeValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when negative values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set negative values (for example, a=-2.0 and b=-3.0).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with negative values. The expected result is -3.1363636363636362. This test is significant as it tests the scenario where the values might be incorrectly set as negative.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithMaxValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when maximum values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set maximum values (for example, a=Double.MAX_VALUE and b=Double.MAX_VALUE).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with maximum values. The expected result is Double.MAX_VALUE. This test is significant as it tests the scenario where the maximum possible values are used.

/*
The error log indicates that the test `testAverageWithNormalValues` failed because the actual value returned by the `getAverage` method did not match the expected value. The expected value was `3.1363636363636362`, but the actual value returned was `2.6818181818181817`.

The `getAverage` method calculates the average based on the formula `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0;`. In the test method, only values for 'a' and 'b' are set, but 'c' is not set and remains `null`. This is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual results.

Since 'c' is not set, Java's automatic null handling converts it into a default value, which for double is `0.0`. Therefore, the equation becomes `(2.0 * 2.0 + 3.0 * 3.0 + 0.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = 2.6818181818181817`, which is the actual result returned by the test.

To fix the test, you need to either adjust the expected value to match the current logic of the `getAverage` method, or modify the test to set a value for 'c'.

The error log indicates that the test `testAverageWithNegativeValues` failed because the actual value returned by the `getAverage` method did not match the expected value. The expected value was `-3.1363636363636362`, but the actual value returned was `-2.6818181818181817`.

The `getAverage` method calculates the average of three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with weights 2, 3, and 5 respectively. In the test, you're only setting the value of `a` and `b`, but not `c`. Since `c` is not set, it defaults to `0.0` as it is a primitive data type `double`. This impacts the average calculation.

The test expects the average of `-2.0` (weight 2), `-3.0` (weight 3), and `0.0` (weight 5) which is `-2.6818181818181817` and not `-3.1363636363636362`. Therefore, the test fails because the expected value is incorrect. You should revise the expected value in your test or set a value for `c` if that was the intention.

/*
The test is failing due to an arithmetic overflow. In the test case, you are setting the values of the fields 'a' and 'b' to Double.MAX_VALUE, which is the maximum positive finite value for a double in Java. 

When the getAverage() method is called, it calculates the average as (a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0. Given that 'a' and 'b' are set to Double.MAX_VALUE, this calculation results in a value that is larger than Double.MAX_VALUE, which in Java is represented as Infinity.

The test case then fails because it is expecting the average to be Double.MAX_VALUE, but the actual result is Infinity.

To fix the test, you would need to adjust the values of 'a' and 'b' so that the calculation in getAverage() does not result in a value larger than Double.MAX_VALUE. Alternatively, if the test is specifically designed to check the handling of maximum values, then the expected result should be changed to Infinity.
