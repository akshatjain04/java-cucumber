ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=sayHello_26998730d5

Scenario 1: Test to verify that the sayHello method returns the correct string
Details:  
    TestName: testSayHelloReturnsCorrectString
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the sayHello method in the Greeter class returns the expected string "Hello World!". The outcome of this test will ensure that the sayHello method is working as expected. 
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected string "Hello World!".
Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the sayHello method correctly returns the string "Hello World!". The expected result is based on the method's specified behavior. The significance of this test is to ensure the correct functionality of the sayHello method, which is crucial for the application's greeting feature.

Scenario 2: Test to verify that the sayHello method does not return null
Details:  
    TestName: testSayHelloDoesNotReturnNull
    Description: This test is designed to ensure that the sayHello method in the Greeter class does not return a null value. The outcome of this test will ensure that the sayHello method is not broken and always returns a value. 
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned string is not null.
Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the sayHello method does not return a null value. The expected result is based on the method's specified behavior. The significance of this test is to prevent NullPointerExceptions in the application, which can occur if the sayHello method returns a null value.

Scenario 3: Test to verify that the sayHello method does not return an empty string
Details:  
    TestName: testSayHelloDoesNotReturnEmptyString
    Description: This test is designed to ensure that the sayHello method in the Greeter class does not return an empty string. The outcome of this test will ensure that the sayHello method always returns a meaningful value. 
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned string is not empty.
Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the sayHello method does not return an empty string. The expected result is based on the method's specified behavior. The significance of this test is to ensure that the greeting feature of the application always provides meaningful output to the user.
