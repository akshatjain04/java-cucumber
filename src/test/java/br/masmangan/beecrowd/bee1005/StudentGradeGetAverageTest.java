"""
Scenario 1: Test for Normal Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithNormalValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when normal values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set normal values (for example, a=2.0 and b=3.0).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with normal values. The expected result is 3.1363636363636362. This test is significant as it tests the basic functionality of the getAverage method.

Scenario 2: Test for Zero Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithZeroValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when zero values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set zero values (for example, a=0.0 and b=0.0).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with zero values. The expected result is 0.0. This test is significant as it tests the scenario where the student has scored zero in both the subjects.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithNegativeValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when negative values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set negative values (for example, a=-2.0 and b=-3.0).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with negative values. The expected result is -3.1363636363636362. This test is significant as it tests the scenario where the values might be incorrectly set as negative.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithMaxValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when maximum values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set maximum values (for example, a=Double.MAX_VALUE and b=Double.MAX_VALUE).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with maximum values. The expected result is Double.MAX_VALUE. This test is significant as it tests the scenario where the maximum possible values are used.

/*
The test `testAverageWithNormalValues` is failing due to an assertion error. The expected value in the assertion is `3.1363636363636362`, but the actual result returned by the `getAverage` method is `2.6818181818181817`. 

The `getAverage` method calculates the average based on the formula `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. In the test, we are only setting values for 'a' and 'b' fields of the `StudentGrade` object, but not for 'c'. As the field 'c' is not set, it will have its default value, which is `0.0` for a double. 

So, the calculation in the `getAverage` method becomes `(2.0 * 2.0 + 3.0 * 3.0 + 0.0 * 5.0) / 10.0`, which results in `2.6818181818181817`. This is why the test is failing as the actual value does not match the expected value in the assertion. 

To fix this test, we should either correct the expected value in the test to match the actual result or set a value for 'c' field in the `StudentGrade` object in the test.

    assertEquals(expected, studentGrade.getAverage());

/*
The test failure is due to an assertion error where the expected and actual results do not match. The expected value in the test case is -3.1363636363636362, but the actual value returned by the getAverage() method is -2.6818181818181817. 

The getAverage() method calculates the average as (a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0. In the test case, only 'a' and 'b' are set with the values -2.0 and -3.0 respectively. The value of 'c' is not set in the test case, so it defaults to 0.0. Therefore, the average is computed as (-2.0 * 2 + -3.0 * 3 + 0 * 5) / 10 = -2.6818181818181817, which is the actual result.

The expected value of -3.1363636363636362 in the test case seems to be a miscalculation. If the intention was to test the method with all negative values, 'c' should be assigned a negative value as well. If the expected value was calculated based on certain values of 'a', 'b' and 'c', then those exact values should be set in the test case. 

So, the test case failure is due to the discrepancy between the expected result and the actual result of the getAverage() method. The test case should be updated with correct expected value or correct values of 'a', 'b' and 'c' should be set to match the expected result.

/*
The test `testAverageWithMaxValues` is failing due to an arithmetic overflow. The business logic method `getAverage()` is trying to add and multiply `Double.MAX_VALUE` which is the largest possible value a double can hold. 

The formula `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0` is trying to calculate the average by multiplying `Double.MAX_VALUE` by 2, 3, and 5 respectively and then adding those results. This operation results in a value greater than `Double.MAX_VALUE` which is not possible to represent in a double, hence the result is `Infinity`. 

The test is expecting the result to be `Double.MAX_VALUE`, but it's actually `Infinity`, which is why the assertion `assertEquals(expected, studentGrade.getAverage());` is failing. 

In order to avoid this overflow, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` need to be adjusted to ensure that their multiplication and addition don't exceed `Double.MAX_VALUE`.
