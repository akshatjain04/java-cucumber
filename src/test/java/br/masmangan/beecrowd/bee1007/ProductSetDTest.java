  Scenario 1: Testing setD method with positive integer input

  Details:
    TestName: setDWithPositiveInteger
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the setD method correctly sets the field 'd' in the Product entity when provided with a positive integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object.
    Act: Invoke the setD method with a positive integer.
    Assert: Use getDifference method to verify that the 'd' field was correctly set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'd' field was correctly set. If the getDifference method returns the correct value after setting 'd', it indicates that 'd' was correctly set. This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of the setD method.

  Scenario 2: Testing setD method with negative integer input

  Details:
    TestName: setDWithNegativeInteger
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the setD method correctly sets the field 'd' in the Product entity when provided with a negative integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object.
    Act: Invoke the setD method with a negative integer.
    Assert: Use getDifference method to verify that the 'd' field was correctly set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'd' field was correctly set even with negative integers. If the getDifference method returns the correct value after setting 'd', it indicates that 'd' was correctly set. This test is important as it checks the robustness of the setD method.

  Scenario 3: Testing setD method with zero input

  Details:
    TestName: setDWithZero
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the setD method correctly sets the field 'd' in the Product entity when provided with zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object.
    Act: Invoke the setD method with zero.
    Assert: Use getDifference method to verify that the 'd' field was correctly set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'd' field was correctly set even with zero. If the getDifference method returns the correct value after setting 'd', it indicates that 'd' was correctly set. This test is significant as it ensures that the setD method works correctly with edge cases.
