"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are positive. This is a basic functionality check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 2: Case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllZeroGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are zero. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 3: Case where all grades are negative

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are negative. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 4: Case where grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithMixedGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when grades a, b, c are a mix of positive and negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with a mix of positive and negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers. This is another functionality check for the getAverage() method.

/*
The test failure is due to the incorrect expected result in the test case. 

The method `getAverage()` in the business logic calculates the average using the formula `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. The test case `testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades()` sets the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as `2.0`, `3.0`, and `5.0` respectively. So, the expected result should be `(2.0 * 2.0 + 3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = 3.8`.

However, in the test case, the expected result is set as `3.7` which is incorrect. Hence, the assertion `assertEquals(3.7, result, 0.001)` fails and the test case fails with the error `org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <3.7> but was: <3.8>`.

Therefore, the test is failing because the expected output of the test case does not match the actual output from the business logic. The expected output in the test case needs to be corrected to `3.8` for the test case to pass.

/*
The test failure is due to the incorrect expected result in the test case. 

The test case is setting the values of a, b, and c as -2.0, -3.0, and -5.0 respectively. In the business logic, these values are then multiplied by 2, 3, and 5 respectively and then divided by 10 to get the average. The calculation would be as follows:

(-2.0 * 2.0 + -3.0 * 3.0 + -5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = -3.8

However, the test case is asserting that the expected result is -3.7, which is not the case based on the calculation above. The correct expected result should be -3.8. Therefore, the test case is failing because of the incorrect expectation, not because of a problem with the business logic or the test setup.

/*
The test failure is due to an incorrect expectation in the test method. The test method `testAverageWithMixedGrades()` sets the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to 2.0, -3.0, and 5.0 respectively, and then calls the `getAverage()` method which calculates the average based on the formula `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`.

Given the set values, the result of `getAverage()` would be `(2.0 * 2.0 + -3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0` which equals `2.0`. However, the test method is asserting that the result should be `2.3`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the test is failing because of an incorrect expectation. The expected result should be `2.0`, not `2.3`.
