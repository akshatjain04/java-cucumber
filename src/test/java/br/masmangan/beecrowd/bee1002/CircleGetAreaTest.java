Scenario 1: Validate the area of the circle when the radius is zero

Details:
TestName: testAreaWhenRadiusIsZero
Description: This test is meant to check the area of the circle when the radius is set to zero. The expected area should also be zero in this case.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Circle entity and set the radius to zero.
Act: Invoke the getArea method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned area is zero.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with radius zero is also zero. This is significant as it validates the mathematical formula that the area of a circle is PI times the radius squared.

Scenario 2: Validate the area of the circle when the radius is positive

Details:
TestName: testAreaWhenRadiusIsPositive
Description: This test is meant to check the area of the circle when the radius is set to a positive number. The expected area should be PI times the radius squared.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Circle entity and set the radius to a positive number.
Act: Invoke the getArea method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned area is as expected.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a positive radius is calculated correctly. This is significant as it ensures the correct implementation of the mathematical formula.

Scenario 3: Validate the area of the circle when the radius is negative

Details:
TestName: testAreaWhenRadiusIsNegative
Description: This test is meant to check the area of the circle when the radius is set to a negative number. The expected area should be NaN because the square of a negative number is a positive, but a circle cannot have a negative radius.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Circle entity and set the radius to a negative number.
Act: Invoke the getArea method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned area is NaN.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a negative radius is NaN. This is significant as it is consistent with the mathematical principle that a circle cannot have a negative radius.
