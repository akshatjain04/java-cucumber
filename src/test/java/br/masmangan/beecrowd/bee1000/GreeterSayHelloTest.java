ROOST_METHOD_HASH=sayHello_52ad62746f
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=sayHello_26998730d5

Scenario 1: Test to verify that the sayHello method returns the correct string
Details:  
    TestName: verifySayHelloReturnsCorrectString
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the sayHello method in the Greeter class returns the expected string "Hello World!". The outcome of this test will ensure that the sayHello method is working as expected. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as there are no parameters or conditions for the sayHello method.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello method.
    Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals method to compare the actual result from the sayHello method with the expected result "Hello World!".
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the sayHello method returns the expected string "Hello World!". The expected result is based on the method's defined behavior. This test is crucial as it validates the core functionality of the sayHello method.

Scenario 2: Test to verify that the sayHello method does not return null
Details:  
    TestName: verifySayHelloDoesNotReturnNull
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the sayHello method in the Greeter class does not return a null value. The outcome of this test will ensure that the sayHello method is not faulty and always returns a value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as there are no parameters or conditions for the sayHello method.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello method.
    Assert: Use JUnit's assertNotNull method to verify that the result from the sayHello method is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the sayHello method does not return a null value. This test is crucial as it ensures that the method always returns a value and does not cause exceptions or errors in the program. 

Scenario 3: Test to verify that the sayHello method does not return an empty string
Details:  
    TestName: verifySayHelloDoesNotReturnEmptyString
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the sayHello method in the Greeter class does not return an empty string. The outcome of this test will ensure that the sayHello method always returns a non-empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as there are no parameters or conditions for the sayHello method.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello method.
    Assert: Use JUnit's assertFalse method to verify that the result from the sayHello method is not an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the sayHello method does not return an empty string. This test is crucial as it ensures that the method always returns a meaningful result and does not cause issues in the program.
