"""
Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive numbers

Details:  
TestName: testGetAverageWithPositiveNumbers
Description: This test checks the getAverage method when all the grades (a, b, c) are positive numbers. 
Execution:
Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using the methods setA(), setB() and setC().
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation: 
This assertion verifies the correctness of the average calculation when all grades are positive numbers. It ensures the correct weightage is given to each grade in the average calculation.

Scenario 2: Edge case where all grades are zero

Details:  
TestName: testGetAverageWithZeroGrades
Description: This test checks the getAverage method when all the grades (a, b, c) are zero. 
Execution:
Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using the methods setA(), setB() and setC().
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average (which should be zero).
Validation: 
This assertion verifies the correctness of the average calculation when all grades are zero. It checks if the method can handle zero values correctly.

Scenario 3: Edge case where grades are negative numbers

Details:  
TestName: testGetAverageWithNegativeNumbers
Description: This test checks the getAverage method when all the grades (a, b, c) are negative numbers. 
Execution:
Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using the methods setA(), setB() and setC().
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation: 
This assertion verifies the correctness of the average calculation when all grades are negative numbers. It ensures the method can handle negative values correctly.

Scenario 4: Normal case where grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers

Details:  
TestName: testGetAverageWithMixedNumbers
Description: This test checks the getAverage method when the grades (a, b, c) are a mix of positive and negative numbers. 
Execution:
Arrange: Set a, b and c with a mix of positive and negative numbers using the methods setA(), setB() and setC().
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation: 
This assertion verifies the correctness of the average calculation when grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers. It checks if the method can handle such scenarios correctly.

The test case is failing because the expected value of the average is not matching the actual value returned by the 'getAverage' method. The test case is expecting 3.9, but the method is returning 3.8. 

The 'getAverage' method calculates the average as per the given formula - (a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0. If we substitute a=2.0, b=3.0, c=5.0 in this formula, the result is 3.8, not 3.9. 

Hence, the test case is failing because of the incorrect expected value. The test case should be corrected to expect 3.8 instead of 3.9.

/*
The test "testGetAverageWithNegativeNumbers" is failing because the expected average value is not matching with the actual average value calculated by the method "getAverage". The test expects the average to be -3.9, but the method is returning -3.8. 

This discrepancy is due to the incorrect calculation in the test setup. The test has set the values of a, b, and c as -2.0, -3.0, and -5.0 respectively. According to the business logic in the method "getAverage", the average is calculated as (a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0. So the average of these values would be (-2.0 * 2.0 + -3.0 * 3.0 + -5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 which equals to -3.8, not -3.9. Hence, the test assertion is failing. 

The test should be corrected to expect -3.8 as the average for the given input values.

/*
The test case is failing because the expected value of the average is not matching the actual value returned by the 'getAverage' method. The test case is expecting 2.9, but the method is returning 3.0. 

The 'getAverage' method calculates the average using the formula (a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0, where the values of a, b, and c are set as -2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 respectively in the test case. 

If we substitute these values into the formula, we get the result as 3.0, which is the actual value returned by the method. Therefore, the method is working correctly, but the expected value in the test case is wrong.

The test case should be corrected to expect 3.0 instead of 2.9. This is why the test case is failing.
