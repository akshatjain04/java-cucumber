"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithPositiveNumbers
    Description: This test checks the average calculation of the 'getAverage' method with positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set 'a', 'b', and 'c' to any positive values.
    Act: Invoke the 'getAverage' method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average calculation is correct. The test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the 'getAverage' method.

  Scenario 2: Edge case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithZeroValues
    Description: This test checks the average calculation of the 'getAverage' method when all grade values are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set 'a', 'b', and 'c' to 0.
    Act: Invoke the 'getAverage' method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is 0.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average calculation is correct when all grades are zero. This test checks the method's behavior in edge cases.

  Scenario 3: Case where grades are negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithNegativeNumbers
    Description: This test checks the average calculation of the 'getAverage' method with negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set 'a', 'b', and 'c' to any negative values.
    Act: Invoke the 'getAverage' method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average calculation is correct with negative values. This test checks the method's ability to handle negative inputs.

  Scenario 4: Case where grades are mix of positive, negative and zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithMixedNumbers
    Description: This test checks the average calculation of the 'getAverage' method with mixed numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set 'a' to a positive number, 'b' to 0, and 'c' to a negative number.
    Act: Invoke the 'getAverage' method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average calculation is correct with mixed values. This test checks the method's ability to handle mixed inputs.

/*
The unit test "testAverageWithPositiveNumbers" is failing due to the discrepancy in the expected and actual results of the average calculation. The expected value of the average is set to 3.7, while the actual result of the computation is 3.8. 

This discrepancy is because of the incorrect expected value in the test case. The "getAverage()" method calculates the weighted average of 'a', 'b', and 'c' where 'a' is multiplied by 2.0, 'b' by 3.0, and 'c' by 5.0 and then the sum is divided by 10.0. Given the values of 'a' as 2.0, 'b' as 3.0, and 'c' as 5.0, the calculated average would be 3.8, not 3.7. 

Therefore, the test case fails the equality assertion because the expected value (3.7) does not match the actual computed value (3.8). To fix this issue, the expected value in the test case should be corrected to 3.8.

/*
The unit test "testAverageWithNegativeNumbers" is failing due to the discrepancy in the expected and actual results. The test was expecting the average to be -3.7, but the actual average returned was -3.8.

The method "getAverage" calculates the weighted average of three numbers 'a', 'b', and 'c' with weights 2, 3, and 5 respectively. The total weight is 10. The test inputs are -2.0, -3.0, and -5.0. The correct weighted average for these inputs is -3.8, which is the actual output returned by the method. 

Therefore, the test failure is due to an incorrect expectation set in the test case. The expected value should have been -3.8, not -3.7. The business logic of the method "getAverage" and its implementation are correct. The test case needs to be corrected with the right expected value to pass.

    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();
    studentGrade.setA(-2.0);
    studentGrade.setB(-3.0);

    double expected = -3.7;
    double actual = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(expected, actual, "The average calculation should be correct with negative numbers");

/*
The unit test "testAverageWithMixedNumbers" is failing because the actual result of the method getAverage() is not equal to the expected result. The test case expects the average to be -1.6 when the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' fields are 2.0, 0.0, and -5.0 respectively.

However, the getAverage() method in the StudentGrade class calculates the average as ((a * 2.0) + (b * 3.0) + (c * 5.0)) / 10.0. Given the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c', the actual average returned by the function is -2.1.

The error log clearly states that the assertion in the test case failed because the expected value was -1.6 but the actual value returned by the method was -2.1. This discrepancy between the expected and actual results is the reason for the failure of the test case.

Hence, the test case is failing because the expected result is incorrect according to the implemented business logic. The expected result should be -2.1 based on the current implementation of the getAverage() method.
