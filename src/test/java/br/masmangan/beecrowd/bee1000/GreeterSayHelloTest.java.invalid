"Scenario 1: Basic Hello World Test

Details:  
  TestName: sayHelloBasicTest
  Description: This test checks if the sayHello() method is returning the correct hello world string. The target scenario is when the method is called without any parameters or special conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are passed to the method.
  Act: Invoke the sayHello() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string matches "Hello World!".
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the sayHello() method is returning the correct string. The expected result is "Hello World!" because this is the hardcoded return value of the method. This test validates if the basic functionality of the method is working correctly.

Scenario 2: Null Test

Details:  
  TestName: sayHelloNullTest
  Description: This test checks if the sayHello() method handles null conditions properly. The target scenario is when the method is invoked without any parameters or special conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are passed to the method.
  Act: Invoke the sayHello() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string is not null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the sayHello() method does not return a null value. The expected result is a non-null value because the method is hardcoded to return a specific string, "Hello World!". This test validates the robustness of the method against null conditions.

Scenario 3: Empty String Test

Details:  
  TestName: sayHelloEmptyTest
  Description: This test checks if the sayHello() method handles empty string conditions properly. The target scenario is when the method is invoked without any parameters or special conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as no parameters are passed to the method.
  Act: Invoke the sayHello() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string is not empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the sayHello() method does not return an empty string. The expected result is a non-empty string because the method is hardcoded to return a specific string, "Hello World!". This test validates the robustness of the method against empty string conditions.
