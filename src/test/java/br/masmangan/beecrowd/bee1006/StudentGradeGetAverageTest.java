"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are positive. This is a basic functionality check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 2: Case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllZeroGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are zero. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 3: Case where all grades are negative

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are negative. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 4: Case where grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithMixedGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when grades a, b, c are a mix of positive and negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with a mix of positive and negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers. This is another functionality check for the getAverage() method.

/*
The test failure is due to an incorrect assertion in the test case. The `getAverage()` method in the `StudentGrade` class is defined as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. In the test case, the values of a, b, and c are set to 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 respectively. 

Using these values, the result of the `getAverage()` method would be `(2.0 * 2.0 + 3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = 3.8`. However, the test case asserts that the expected value should be 3.7, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the test case fails with the error message "expected: <3.7> but was: <3.8>", indicating that the expected value (3.7) does not match the actual result (3.8). To fix this, the expected value in the test case should be updated to 3.8.

/*
The test failure is due to an incorrect assertion in the test case. The test is trying to set the grades a, b, and c as -2.0, -3.0, and -5.0 respectively and then checks if the average is -3.7. However, based on the business logic provided in the getAverage() method, the calculated average of these grades should be -3.8 and not -3.7.

The getAverage() method calculates the average as (a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0. If we substitute the values from the test case into this formula, we get (-2.0 * 2.0 + -3.0 * 3.0 + -5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = -3.8. Therefore, the assertion in the test case is incorrect because it expects the average to be -3.7 when it should be -3.8.

This is why the test case is failing as per the error log: "org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <-3.7> but was: <-3.8>". The test case expected the result to be -3.7 but the actual result returned by the getAverage() method was -3.8. 

So, there's no issue with the business logic in getAverage() method or the test function's compilation. The test case just needs to be corrected to expect the right average based on the input values.

    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();
    studentGrade.setA(-2.0);

    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(-3.7, result, 0.001);

/*
The test case `testAverageWithMixedGrades` is failing because the expected result does not match the actual result. The test case expects the average to be `2.3`, but the actual result is `2.0`.

In the `getAverage` method, the average is calculated as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. Given the values `a=2.0`, `b=-3.0`, and `c=5.0`, the average would be `(2.0 * 2.0 + -3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = 20.0 / 10.0 = 2.0`.

Therefore, the test case is failing because the expected result `2.3` is incorrect given the calculation logic and the provided input values. The correct expected result should be `2.0` according to the current calculation logic in the `getAverage` method.
