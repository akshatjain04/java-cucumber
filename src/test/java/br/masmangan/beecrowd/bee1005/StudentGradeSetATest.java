Scenario 1: Validate Correct Assignment of 'a' Grade

Details:
  TestName: testCorrectAssignmentOfAGrade
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setA correctly assigns the provided grade to the student's 'a' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Define a double value to represent the 'a' grade.
  Act: Invoke the setA method on the instance of StudentGrade, passing the defined 'a' grade.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the average grade calculated by getAverage method against the expected average.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'a' grade has been correctly assigned. The expected result is based on the calculation (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is significant as it ensures the integrity of the student's 'a' grade.

Scenario 2: Validate Negative Value Assignment to 'a' Grade

Details:
  TestName: testNegativeValueAssignmentToAGrade
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setA correctly handles the scenario when a negative value is provided as 'a' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Define a negative double value to represent the 'a' grade.
  Act: Invoke the setA method on the instance of StudentGrade, passing the defined 'a' grade.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the average grade calculated by getAverage method against the expected average.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'a' grade does not accept negative values. The expected result is based on the calculation (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0, considering 'a' as zero if a negative value is provided. This test is significant as it ensures the integrity of the student's 'a' grade in a scenario of invalid input.

Scenario 3: Validate Large Value Assignment to 'a' Grade

Details:
  TestName: testLargeValueAssignmentToAGrade
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setA correctly handles the scenario when a large value is provided as 'a' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Define a large double value to represent the 'a' grade.
  Act: Invoke the setA method on the instance of StudentGrade, passing the defined 'a' grade.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the average grade calculated by getAverage method against the expected average.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'a' grade can handle large values. The expected result is based on the calculation (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is significant as it verifies the method's ability to handle a wide range of input values.

/*
The test `testNegativeValueAssignmentToAGrade` is failing at the assertion stage where it is expecting the `actualAverage` to be `0.0`, but it is getting `-1.5909090909090908`. This suggests that the method `getAverage()` is not handling the situation where a grade value is negative.

The test sets the grade `a` to `-5.0` and then calculates the average. It seems that the test is assuming that if a negative value is provided, it should be treated as `0` in the average calculation. However, the actual value returned by `getAverage()` suggests that it's not treating negative values as `0`, it's using the actual negative value in the calculation.

Therefore, the failure is due to a discrepancy between the business logic and the test's assumption about how negative grades should be handled. The `setA()` method or `getAverage()` method might need to be adjusted to account for negative values, or if negative values are valid, the test's assumption that they should be treated as `0` would need to be revised.
