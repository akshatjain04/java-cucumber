  Scenario 1: Testing setA method with valid positive input

  Details:  
    TestName: setAWithPositiveInput
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the setA method correctly sets the field 'a' in the Product entity when provided with a valid positive integer. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Product entity. 
    Act: Invoke the setA method with a valid positive integer as the parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual 'a' value in the Product entity with the expected value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly sets the 'a' field in the Product entity. The expected result is based on the known behavior of the setA method. This test is significant as it ensures the proper functioning of the setA method with standard input.

  Scenario 2: Testing setA method with negative input

  Details:  
    TestName: setAWithNegativeInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the functioning of the setA method when provided with a negative integer. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Product entity. 
    Act: Invoke the setA method with a negative integer as the parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual 'a' value in the Product entity with the expected value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly handles negative input. The expected result is based on the known behavior of the setA method. This test is important as it checks the robustness of the setA method.

  Scenario 3: Testing setA method with zero as input

  Details:  
    TestName: setAWithZeroInput
    Description: This test is designed to check the operation of the setA method when the input is zero. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Product entity. 
    Act: Invoke the setA method with zero as the parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the 'a' value in the Product entity is indeed zero.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to confirm that the setA method correctly sets the 'a' field to zero when the input is zero. The expected result is based on the known behavior of the setA method. This test is significant as it ensures the correct operation of the setA method with zero as input.
