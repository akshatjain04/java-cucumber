  Scenario 1: Testing setA method with valid positive input

  Details:  
    TestName: setAWithPositiveInput
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the setA method correctly sets the field 'a' in the Product entity when provided with a valid positive integer. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Product entity. 
    Act: Invoke the setA method with a valid positive integer as the parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual 'a' value in the Product entity with the expected value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly sets the 'a' field in the Product entity when provided with a positive integer. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the setA method.

  Scenario 2: Testing setA method with zero input

  Details:  
    TestName: setAWithZeroInput
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the setA method correctly sets the field 'a' in the Product entity when provided with zero as input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Product entity. 
    Act: Invoke the setA method with zero as the parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual 'a' value in the Product entity with the expected value (zero).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly sets the 'a' field in the Product entity when provided with zero as input. This test is significant as it checks the setA method's handling of zero input.

  Scenario 3: Testing setA method with negative input

  Details:  
    TestName: setAWithNegativeInput
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the setA method correctly sets the field 'a' in the Product entity when provided with a negative integer. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Product entity. 
    Act: Invoke the setA method with a negative integer as the parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual 'a' value in the Product entity with the expected value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setA method correctly sets the 'a' field in the Product entity when provided with a negative integer. This test is significant as it checks the setA method's handling of negative input.

  Scenario 4: Testing the impact of setA method on getDifference method

  Details:  
    TestName: setAImpactOnGetDifference
    Description: This test is meant to check whether changing the 'a' field in the Product entity using the setA method correctly affects the output of the getDifference method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Product entity and set the fields 'b', 'c', and 'd'. 
    Act: Invoke the setA method with a certain value as the parameter. Then, invoke the getDifference method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual output of the getDifference method with the expected output.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that changing the 'a' field in the Product entity using the setA method correctly affects the output of the getDifference method. This test is significant as it checks the interaction between the setA method and the getDifference method.
