"Scenario 1: Test getProduct with positive integers

Details:
  TestName: testGetProductWithPositiveIntegers
  Description: This test is to verify the getProduct method when both input numbers are positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a Calculator instance and use the setA and setB methods to set the values of a and b to positive integers.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: The returned value should be the product of the two positive integers.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getProduct method correctly calculates the product of two positive integers. This is a basic functionality of the method and it is important for the Calculator class to handle this correctly.

Scenario 2: Test getProduct with zero

Details:
  TestName: testGetProductWithZero
  Description: This test is to verify the getProduct method when one of the input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a Calculator instance and use the setA and setB methods to set the value of one variable as zero and the other as a positive integer.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: The returned value should be zero.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getProduct method correctly returns zero when one of the inputs is zero. This is a basic functionality of the method and it is important for the Calculator class to handle this correctly.

Scenario 3: Test getProduct with negative integers

Details:
  TestName: testGetProductWithNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test is to verify the getProduct method when both input numbers are negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a Calculator instance and use the setA and setB methods to set the values of a and b to negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: The returned value should be the product of the two negative integers, which is a positive integer.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getProduct method correctly calculates the product of two negative integers. This is a basic functionality of the method and it is important for the Calculator class to handle this correctly.

Scenario 4: Test getProduct with one positive and one negative integer

Details:
  TestName: testGetProductWithOnePositiveAndOneNegativeInteger
  Description: This test is to verify the getProduct method when one input number is a positive integer and the other is a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a Calculator instance and use the setA and setB methods to set the values of a and b to one positive and one negative integer.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method.
  Assert: The returned value should be the product of the positive and negative integer, which is a negative integer.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getProduct method correctly calculates the product of a positive and a negative integer. This is a basic functionality of the method and it is important for the Calculator class to handle this correctly.
