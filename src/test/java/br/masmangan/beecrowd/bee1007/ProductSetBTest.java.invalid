Scenario 1: Testing with a positive integer
TestName: testSetBWithPositiveInteger
Description: This test aims to check the setB method when a positive integer is provided as input.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Product object.
Act: Invoke the setB method with a positive integer.
Assert: Verify that the value of b has been updated to the provided integer.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the setB method correctly updates the value of b when a positive integer is provided. This is critical for ensuring that the Product object can correctly store and retrieve its properties.

Scenario 2: Testing with a negative integer
TestName: testSetBWithNegativeInteger
Description: This test aims to check the setB method when a negative integer is provided as input.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Product object.
Act: Invoke the setB method with a negative integer.
Assert: Verify that the value of b has been updated to the provided integer.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the setB method correctly updates the value of b when a negative integer is provided. This is important for ensuring that the Product object can correctly handle negative values.

Scenario 3: Testing with zero
TestName: testSetBWithZero
Description: This test aims to check the setB method when zero is provided as input.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Product object.
Act: Invoke the setB method with zero.
Assert: Verify that the value of b has been updated to zero.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the setB method correctly updates the value of b when zero is provided. This is important for ensuring that the Product object can correctly handle zero values.

Scenario 4: Testing the impact on getDifference method after setting B
TestName: testImpactOnGetDifferenceAfterSettingB
Description: This test aims to check the impact on the getDifference method after setting a value for B.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Product object and set values for a, c, and d.
Act: Invoke the setB method with a certain value and then invoke the getDifference method.
Assert: Verify that the getDifference method returns the correct value based on the new value of B.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the getDifference method correctly calculates the difference based on the updated value of B. This is critical for ensuring the correct behavior of the getDifference method after setting a value for B.
