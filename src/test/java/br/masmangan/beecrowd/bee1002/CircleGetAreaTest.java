"""
Scenario 1: Test for Zero Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithZeroRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns 0 when the radius is set to 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to 0.
  Act: Call the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Check if the returned area is 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with radius 0 is indeed 0. This is important as it checks if the method correctly handles the edge case where the radius is 0.

Scenario 2: Test for Positive Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithPositiveRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns the correct value when the radius is a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to a positive number.
  Act: Call the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Check if the returned area is equal to PI*radius*radius.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a positive radius is calculated correctly. This is crucial as it confirms the basic functionality of the getArea method.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithNegativeRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns a sensible value when the radius is a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to a negative number.
  Act: Call the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Check if the returned area is a sensible value (since a circle cannot have a negative radius, the method might return 0, or the absolute value of radius squared times PI, depending on the implementation).
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a negative radius is handled correctly. This is important as it checks if the method can appropriately handle unexpected inputs.
  
Scenario 4: Test for Large Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithLargeRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method can handle large radius values without overflow or precision loss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to a very large number.
  Act: Call the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Check if the returned area is sensible and does not result in an overflow error.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getArea method can handle large radius values. This is crucial for ensuring that the method can handle a wide range of inputs without error.
