"Scenario 1: Test when radius is zero
  Details:
    TestName: testAreaWithZeroRadius
    Description: This test is meant to check the area when the radius is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to zero.
    Act: Invoke the getArea method.
    Assert: Assert if the area is zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the area is zero when the radius is zero. This is expected because the area of a circle with no radius is zero. This test is significant because it tests the lower boundary case for the radius of a circle.

Scenario 2: Test when radius is a positive number
  Details:
    TestName: testAreaWithPositiveRadius
    Description: This test is meant to check the area when the radius is a positive number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to a positive number.
    Act: Invoke the getArea method.
    Assert: Assert if the area is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the area is calculated correctly when the radius is a positive number. This is expected because the area of a circle is calculated as PI * radius * radius. This test is significant because it tests the normal functioning of the getArea method.

Scenario 3: Test when radius is a negative number
  Details:
    TestName: testAreaWithNegativeRadius
    Description: This test is meant to check the area when the radius is a negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to a negative number.
    Act: Invoke the getArea method.
    Assert: Assert if the area is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the area is calculated correctly even when the radius is a negative number. This is expected because the area of a circle is always a positive number, regardless of the sign of the radius. This test is significant because it tests the error handling of the getArea method.

Scenario 4: Test when radius is a very large number
  Details:
    TestName: testAreaWithVeryLargeRadius
    Description: This test is meant to check the area when the radius is a very large number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to a very large number.
    Act: Invoke the getArea method.
    Assert: Assert if the area is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the area is calculated correctly even when the radius is a very large number. This is expected because the area of a circle is calculated as PI * radius * radius. This test is significant because it tests the handling of large numbers by the getArea method.
