"""
Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive numbers

Details:  
TestName: testGetAverageWithPositiveNumbers
Description: This test checks the getAverage method when all the grades (a, b, c) are positive numbers. 
Execution:
Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using the methods setA(), setB() and setC().
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation: 
This assertion verifies the correctness of the average calculation when all grades are positive numbers. It's significant as it validates the basic functionality of the getAverage method.

Scenario 2: Case where all grades are zero

Details:  
TestName: testGetAverageWithZeroGrades
Description: This test checks the getAverage method when all the grades (a, b, c) are zero. 
Execution:
Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using the methods setA(), setB() and setC().
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average which is also zero.
Validation: 
This assertion verifies if the getAverage method can handle the edge case where all grades are zero. This is important because it checks if the method can handle edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Case where some grades are negative

Details:  
TestName: testGetAverageWithNegativeGrades
Description: This test checks the getAverage method when some of the grades (a, b, c) are negative numbers. 
Execution:
Arrange: Set a, b and c with some negative numbers using the methods setA(), setB() and setC().
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation: 
This assertion verifies if the getAverage method can handle the case where some grades are negative numbers. This is important as it checks if the method can handle different types of input data.

Scenario 4: Case where all grades are negative

Details:  
TestName: testGetAverageWithAllNegativeGrades
Description: This test checks the getAverage method when all the grades (a, b, c) are negative numbers. 
Execution:
Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using the methods setA(), setB() and setC().
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation: 
This assertion verifies if the getAverage method can handle the edge case where all grades are negative numbers. This is important as it checks if the method can handle edge cases correctly.

/*
The test case `testGetAverageWithPositiveNumbers` is failing because the expected value does not match the actual value. The expected value was set to `3.7` in the test case but the actual value returned from the `getAverage` method was `3.8`.

The `getAverage` method is designed to calculate the average of three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` with weights 2, 3, and 5 respectively. The weights are then divided by 10 to get the average. 

When the values `a=2.0`, `b=3.0`, and `c=5.0` are passed to the `getAverage` method, the calculated average is `3.8`, not `3.7` as expected in the test case.

Therefore, the test case is failing because the expected value `3.7` is incorrect. The correct expected value should be `3.8` based on the weights and values provided. The test case needs to be updated with the correct expected value for it to pass.

/*
The test case `testGetAverageWithNegativeGrades` is failing because the expected output value is not matching the actual output value. 

The test expects the value of 2.3, however, the actual output of the method `getAverage` is 3.0. The discrepancy is because of the negative value of 'a' set in the test case. The `getAverage` method is calculating the average using the formula `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`, which does not handle negative values in a special way. 

As a result, the negative value of 'a' is reducing the overall sum in the numerator, hence the average is higher than expected. The logic of the `getAverage` method doesn't seem to account for the possibility of negative grades, which is a valid scenario in the test case.

To fix this test, the test case should either not include negative values, or the `getAverage` method needs to be updated to handle negative values appropriately, depending on the business requirements.
@Test

public void testGetAverageWithNegativeGrades() {
    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();
    studentGrade.setA(-2.0);
    studentGrade.setB(3.0);
    studentGrade.setC(5.0);
    double expectedAverage = 2.3;
    assertEquals(expectedAverage, studentGrade.getAverage());
}
*/
/*
The test failure is due to an incorrect expected value in the test case. The test case expects the average to be -3.7 while the actual average returned by the getAverage method is -3.8.

The getAverage method calculates the average as (a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0. In the test case, a, b, and c are assigned the values -2.0, -3.0, and -5.0 respectively. So, the calculated average would be ((-2.0 * 2.0) + (-3.0 * 3.0) + (-5.0 * 5.0)) / 10.0 which equals to -3.8. 

Therefore, the test case fails because the expected value of -3.7 does not match the actual calculated value of -3.8. To fix this issue, the expected value in the test case should be changed to -3.8.
