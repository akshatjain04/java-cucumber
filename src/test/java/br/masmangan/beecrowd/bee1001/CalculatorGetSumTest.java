ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSum_d38a33793d

Scenario 1: Validate getSum with positive numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are positive. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator object and set values of a and b to positive numbers using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Confirm that the sum of a and b is correctly calculated and returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds two positive numbers. This is important to ensure accurate calculations in the application.

Scenario 2: Validate getSum with negative numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are negative. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator object and set values of a and b to negative numbers using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Confirm that the sum of a and b is correctly calculated and returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds two negative numbers. This test is essential to validate the functionality of the getSum method for negative number inputs.

Scenario 3: Validate getSum with zero
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when one of the input numbers is zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator object and set value of a to any number and b to zero using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Confirm that the sum of a and b is correctly calculated and returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds a number with zero. This test is necessary to validate the functionality of the getSum method when one of the inputs is zero.

Scenario 4: Validate getSum with large numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are very large. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator object and set values of a and b to large numbers using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Confirm that the sum of a and b is correctly calculated and returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds two large numbers. This test is important to confirm the functionality of the getSum method for large number inputs.

/*
The test `testGetSumWithLargeNumbers` is failing because of an integer overflow. 

In the test, we are setting the values of `a` and `b` in the `Calculator` object to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. When the `getSum()` method is called, it returns the sum of `a` and `b` as an integer. However, the sum of `a` and `b` is twice the `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which exceeds the maximum limit of an integer in Java. This results in an integer overflow and the sum wraps around to a negative value, specifically `-2`. 

The assertion in the test expects the sum to be equal to `(long) Integer.MAX_VALUE + Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which is the correct sum but as a long value to avoid overflow. Since the `getSum()` method returns an integer and not a long, the assertion fails because the actual sum returned (`-2`) doesn't match the expected sum (`4294967294`). 

In conclusion, the business logic in `getSum()` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the scenario where the sum of `a` and `b` exceeds the maximum limit of an integer.

    assertEquals((long) Integer.MAX_VALUE + Integer.MAX_VALUE, sum);
