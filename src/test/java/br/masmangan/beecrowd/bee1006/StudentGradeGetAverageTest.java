"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithPositiveNumbers
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades (a, b, c) are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set grades a, b, c to be positive numbers.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage() method.
    Assert: Check if the returned average is correct.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the average grade when all grades are positive. The expected result is based on the weighted average formula. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 2: Edge case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithZeroGrades
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades (a, b, c) are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set grades a, b, c to be zero.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage() method.
    Assert: Check if the returned average is zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the average grade when all grades are zero. The expected result is zero since the average of zero grades is zero. This test is significant as it tests the edge case where all grades are zero.

  Scenario 3: Normal case where all grades are negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithNegativeNumbers
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades (a, b, c) are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set grades a, b, c to be negative numbers.
    Act: Invoke the getAverage() method.
    Assert: Check if the returned average is a negative number.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the average grade when all grades are negative. The expected result is a negative number based on the weighted average formula. This test is significant as it checks the method's handling of negative grades.

/*
The test case "testAverageWithPositiveNumbers" is failing because of an assertion error. The assertion error is caused by a mismatch between the expected outcome and the actual result of the method under test.

The test case is designed to check the correctness of the method "getAverage". The method "getAverage" calculates the weighted average of three numbers (a, b, c) with weights 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

In the test case, the values of a, b, and c are set to 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 respectively. The weighted average is calculated as follows: (2.0*2 + 3.0*3 + 5.0*5) / 10 = 3.8.

However, in the assertion step, the expected result is set to 3.7, which is not the correct weighted average of the given numbers. Hence, the assertion fails because the actual result (3.8) is not equal to the expected result (3.7), leading to the test failure.

The error log "Average calculation for positive numbers is incorrect. ==> expected: <3.7> but was: <3.8>" clearly indicates this discrepancy. Therefore, the test is failing due to an incorrect expectation in the test case, not because of an issue in the method under test. 

To fix this issue, the expectation in the test case should be corrected to match the correct weighted average of the given numbers, which is 3.8.

/*
The test case "testAverageWithNegativeNumbers" is failing because of an assertion error. The assertion error is caused by a mismatch between the expected outcome and the actual result of the method under test.

The test case is designed to check the `getAverage` method when the input values are negative. The input values are -2.0, -3.0, and -5.0 for the variables 'a', 'b', and 'c' respectively. The `getAverage` method is expected to return the weighted average of these values, which is -3.7 according to the test case.

However, the actual value returned by the `getAverage` method is -3.8, not -3.7 as expected by the test case. This discrepancy is causing the test case to fail.

The issue seems to be with the expected value in the test case. The weights of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the `getAverage` method are 2, 3, and 5 respectively. So, the weighted average should be ((-2.0 * 2) + (-3.0 * 3) + (-5.0 * 5)) / 10 = -3.8, not -3.7.

Therefore, the test case is failing because the expected value is incorrect. The test case should expect -3.8 as the result of the `getAverage` method when the input values are -2.0, -3.0, and -5.0.
