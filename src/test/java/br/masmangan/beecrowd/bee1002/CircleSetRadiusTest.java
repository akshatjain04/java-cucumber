Scenario 1: Validate the setRadius method with a positive radius value

Details:
  TestName: setRadiusWithPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the setRadius method when provided with a positive value for the radius. It aims to ensure the radius is set correctly and the circle's area is computed accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Circle object and a positive double value for the radius.
  Act: Invoke the setRadius method with the positive double value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the radius has been correctly set by comparing the computed area against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the set radius is correctly reflected in the area of the circle. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula for the area of a circle. This test is significant as it validates the core functionality of the setRadius method under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Validate the setRadius method with a negative radius value

Details:
  TestName: setRadiusWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the setRadius method when provided with a negative value for the radius. It aims to ensure the radius is not set and the circle's area remains as it is.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Circle object with a positive radius and a negative double value for the radius.
  Act: Invoke the setRadius method with the negative double value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the radius has not been set by comparing the computed area against the initial area.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the set radius is not reflected in the area of the circle when a negative value is provided. The expected result is based on the principle that a circle cannot have a negative radius. This test is significant as it validates the robustness of the setRadius method under abnormal conditions.

Scenario 3: Validate the setRadius method with a zero radius value

Details:
  TestName: setRadiusWithZeroValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the setRadius method when provided with a zero value for the radius. It aims to ensure the radius is set correctly and the circle's area becomes zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Circle object with a positive radius and a zero value for the radius.
  Act: Invoke the setRadius method with the zero value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the radius has been correctly set by comparing the computed area against zero.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the set radius is correctly reflected in the area of the circle when a zero value is provided. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula for the area of a circle. This test is significant as it validates the edge case handling of the setRadius method.
