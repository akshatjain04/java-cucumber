"""
Scenario 1: Validate the setRadius method with a positive radius value

Details:
  TestName: setRadiusWithPositiveValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check the setRadius method when provided with a positive value for the radius. It aims to ensure the radius is set correctly and the circle's area is computed accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Circle object and a positive double value for the radius.
  Act: Invoke the setRadius method with the positive double value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the radius of the circle is set correctly and if the area of the circle matches the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the radius is set correctly and the area of the circle is accurate as per the mathematical formula. This test is significant to ensure that the Circle entity behaves correctly when a positive radius is set.

Scenario 2: Validate the setRadius method with a negative radius value

Details:
  TestName: setRadiusWithNegativeValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check the setRadius method when provided with a negative value for the radius. It aims to ensure that the method behaves as expected in this scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Circle object and a negative double value for the radius.
  Act: Invoke the setRadius method with the negative double value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the radius of the circle is set to zero (or) a suitable exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the radius is not set to a negative value, which is not possible in real-world scenarios. This test is significant to ensure that the Circle entity handles erroneous inputs correctly.

Scenario 3: Validate the setRadius method with a zero radius value

Details:
  TestName: setRadiusWithZeroValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check the setRadius method when provided with a zero value for the radius. It aims to ensure the radius is set correctly and the circle's area is computed accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Circle object and a zero double value for the radius.
  Act: Invoke the setRadius method with the zero double value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the radius of the circle is set to zero and if the area of the circle is also zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the radius is set to zero correctly and the area of the circle is also zero. This test is significant to ensure that the Circle entity behaves correctly when a zero radius is set.
