"""
Scenario 1: Test for Zero Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithZeroRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns 0 when the radius is set to 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to 0.
  Act: Call the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Check if the returned area is 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with radius 0 is indeed 0. This is important as it checks if the method correctly handles the edge case where the radius is 0.

Scenario 2: Test for Positive Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithPositiveRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns the correct value when the radius is a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to a positive number.
  Act: Call the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Check if the returned area is equal to PI*radius*radius.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a positive radius is calculated correctly. This is crucial as it confirms the basic functionality of the getArea method.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithNegativeRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method returns a sensible value when the radius is a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to a negative number.
  Act: Call the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Check if the returned area is a sensible value (since a circle cannot have a negative radius, the method might return 0, or the absolute value of radius squared times PI, depending on the implementation).
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a negative radius is handled correctly. This is important as it checks if the method can appropriately handle unexpected inputs.
  
Scenario 4: Test for Large Radius
Details:  
  TestName: testAreaWithLargeRadius
  Description: This test checks if the getArea method can handle large radius values without overflow or precision loss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Circle object and set the radius to a very large number.
  Act: Call the getArea method on the Circle object.
  Assert: Check if the returned area is sensible and does not result in an overflow error.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getArea method can handle large radius values. This is crucial for ensuring that the method can handle a wide range of inputs without error.

/*
The test `testAreaWithNegativeRadius` is failing because the test is assuming that the `getArea` method should return 0 when the radius is negative. However, the `getArea` method does not have any condition to check if the radius is negative. So, when a negative radius is set, the `getArea` method is still calculating the area using the formula PI * radius * radius. 

In this case, the formula is resulting in a positive value because the square of a negative number is positive. This is why the actual value was 78.53975 (which is PI * 5 * 5) instead of the expected 0. 

The test failure is not due to a compilation error or an external dependency, but because of an incorrect assumption in the test case and missing handling of negative radius in `getArea` method. 

To fix the test, the business logic needs to be updated to handle negative radius, or the test case should be updated to expect the calculated area even when the radius is negative.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testAreaWithNegativeRadius() {
    Circle circle = new Circle();
    circle.setRadius(-5);
    double area = circle.getArea();
    // Assuming the implementation returns 0 for negative radius
    assertEquals(0, area, "Area of circle with negative radius should be 0 or a sensible value");
}

/*
The test `testAreaWithLargeRadius` is failing because it's testing the scenario where the radius of the circle is set to a very large value (`Double.MAX_VALUE / 2`). When calculating the area of the circle using the formula `PI * radius * radius`, the result is a value larger than `Double.MAX_VALUE`, which leads to an overflow. 

The overflow results in a special floating-point value `Infinity`, which is not a finite number. Hence, the assertion `assertTrue(Double.isFinite(area))` fails because `area` is `Infinity`, not a finite number.

This is not a compilation or build failure, but a logical error in the test case. If it's necessary to handle such large radius values in the application, then the business logic method `getArea` needs to be adjusted to handle these scenarios properly, for example by checking for overflows. If handling such large radius values is not necessary, the test case could be adjusted to only test with smaller radius values that do not cause an overflow when calculating the area.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
@Tag("boundary")
public void testAreaWithLargeRadius() {
    Circle circle = new Circle();
    // To avoid overflow
    double largeRadius = Double.MAX_VALUE / 2;
    circle.setRadius(largeRadius);
    double area = circle.getArea();
    // Check if the area is a finite number (i.e., no overflow occurred)
    assertTrue(Double.isFinite(area), "Area of circle with large radius should be a finite number");
}
