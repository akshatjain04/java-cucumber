"""
Scenario 1: Test when the value of c is set to null
Details:  
  TestName: testSetCWithNullValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setC method when the input value is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product object.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the Product's c field is null.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the setC method can handle null inputs. It is significant because it covers a potential edge case where the input to the method is null.

Scenario 2: Test when the value of c is set to a positive integer
Details:  
  TestName: testSetCWithPositiveInteger
  Description: This test is designed to test the setC method when the input value is a positive integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product object.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with a positive integer as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the Product's c field is equal to the positive integer.
Validation: 
  This test validates that the setC method correctly sets the c field to the given positive integer. This is important for ensuring that the method works as expected with normal inputs.

Scenario 3: Test when the value of c is set to a negative integer
Details:  
  TestName: testSetCWithNegativeInteger
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setC method when the input value is a negative integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product object.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with a negative integer as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the Product's c field is equal to the negative integer.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the setC method correctly sets the c field to the given negative integer. This is significant for ensuring the method handles negative inputs correctly.

Scenario 4: Test when the value of c is set to zero
Details:  
  TestName: testSetCWithZero
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setC method when the input value is zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product object.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with zero as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the Product's c field is equal to zero.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the setC method correctly sets the c field to zero. This is significant for ensuring the method handles zero inputs correctly.

Scenario 5: Test the setC method in conjunction with the getDifference method
Details:  
  TestName: testSetCWithGetDifference
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setC method in conjunction with the getDifference method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product object and set the values of a, b, d, and c.
  Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the result of getDifference is as expected.
Validation: 
  This test validates that the setC method correctly influences the result of the getDifference method. This is important for ensuring the correct interaction between different methods in the Product class.
