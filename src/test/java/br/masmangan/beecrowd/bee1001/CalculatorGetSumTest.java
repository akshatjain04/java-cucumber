ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSum_d38a33793d

Scenario 1: Validate getSum with positive numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are positive. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator object and use setA and setB methods to set two positive numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the expected sum of the two positive numbers.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds two positive numbers. This test is significant as it checks the basic addition functionality of the Calculator.

Scenario 2: Validate getSum with negative numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are negative. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator object and use setA and setB methods to set two negative numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the expected sum of the two negative numbers.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly adds two negative numbers. This test is significant as it checks the addition functionality of the Calculator when dealing with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Validate getSum with zero
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when one of the input numbers is zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator object and use setA and setB methods to set one number as zero and the other as a positive integer.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the other non-zero number.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly handles the addition of zero. This test is significant as it checks the addition functionality of the Calculator when one of the numbers is zero.

Scenario 4: Validate getSum with large numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are large. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Calculator object and use setA and setB methods to set two large numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the expected sum of the two large numbers.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getSum method correctly handles the addition of large numbers. This test is significant as it checks the Calculator's handling of large numbers to prevent overflow errors.
