"Scenario 1: Testing getSum method with positive integers
Details:
TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveIntegers.
Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method is correctly adding two positive integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set values of a and b as two positive integers using the setA and setB methods.
Act: Invoke the getSum method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected sum of the two positive integers.
Validation:
This assertion verifies if the method can correctly add two positive integers. The expected result is the sum of the two positive integers because addition of two positive integers should yield a positive integer.

Scenario 2: Testing getSum method with negative integers
Details:
TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeIntegers.
Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method is correctly adding two negative integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set values of a and b as two negative integers using the setA and setB methods.
Act: Invoke the getSum method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected sum of the two negative integers.
Validation:
This assertion verifies if the method can correctly add two negative integers. The expected result is the sum of the two negative integers because addition of two negative integers should yield a negative integer.

Scenario 3: Testing getSum method with zero
Details:
TestName: testGetSumWithZero.
Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method is correctly adding an integer and zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Set value of a as an integer and b as zero using the setA and setB methods.
Act: Invoke the getSum method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected sum of the integer and zero.
Validation:
This assertion verifies if the method can correctly add an integer and zero. The expected result is the integer because any number added to zero should equal the number itself.

Scenario 4: Testing getSum method with maximum integers
Details:
TestName: testGetSumWithMaxIntegers.
Description: This test is meant to check if the getSum method correctly handles integer overflow.
Execution:
Arrange: Set values of a and b as maximum integer values using the setA and setB methods.
Act: Invoke the getSum method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to catch any arithmetic exception due to integer overflow.
Validation:
This assertion verifies if the method can handle integer overflow. The expected result is an arithmetic exception because the sum of two maximum integers exceeds the maximum integer value that can be stored.

/*
The test `testGetSumWithMaxIntegers` is designed to check if the method `getSum()` can handle the sum of two maximum integer values (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`). The test is expecting an `ArithmeticException` to be thrown because the sum of two maximum integers exceeds the maximum limit of an integer in Java, leading to an integer overflow.

However, the error ":142 Expected java.lang.ArithmeticException to be thrown, but nothing was thrown." indicates that no exception was thrown when the test was run. 

This indicates that the method `getSum()` does not have a mechanism to handle integer overflow. In other words, the method does not check if the sum of the two integers exceeds the maximum limit of an integer in Java and hence it does not throw an `ArithmeticException` when an integer overflow occurs. This is why the test is failing. 

In order to pass this test, the method `getSum()` needs to be modified to handle integer overflow and throw an `ArithmeticException` when it occurs.
